This repository tracks the configuration of the Energam Foundry VTT setup, including:

- A list of modules that are currently installed
- A list of modules that were once installed but are not installed now (kept for posterity)
- Per-module notes for critical settings or module interactions

## To Do

- The core/ folder has been created but the information for Core settings, D&D 5e, ToV, and other games have not yet been created into that folder
- Update documentation to make sure "Display GM Cursor" is turned off
- Update documentation to make sure NPC healing is not shown to players - Cautious Gamemaster module
- Update documentation to make sure GM ruler is not shown to players
- Fix all of the existing documentation in modules/ to have links to proper image files because ChatGPT is stupid as fuck
- Remove Active Auras from all games
- Need to update documentation for DFreds Convenient Effects since it wasn't working with 5e at the time
- Need to update documentation for DFreds Droppables since it wasn't working with 5e at the time
