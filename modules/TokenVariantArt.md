# Token Variant Art

**Version:** 5.1.6  
**Used In:** All Worlds  
**Purpose:** Allows players to change the appearance of their character tokens to reflect different outfits, armor, or in-game contexts. This supports visual storytelling and player immersion through token customization.

## Configuration Snapshot

This module has extensive configuration options, but only the following settings have been changed from their defaults:

- **Disable Cache Notifications**: Enabled  
- **Token HUD Wildcard | Disable button**: Enabled

## Configuration Notes

The core use case is to empower players to switch between multiple token images for their characters, such as swapping armor sets or changing clothing between social and adventuring scenes. This provides a simple but effective layer of visual roleplay. All other settings remain at their defaults to reduce complexity while still supporting this player-facing functionality.
