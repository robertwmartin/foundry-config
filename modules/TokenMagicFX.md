## Configuration Notes

- **Enable automatic template effects** is turned on to allow effects to automatically apply when a spell template is placed.
- **Disable filter caching on startup** is enabled to reduce visual glitches on load.
- All other settings are left at default for now.
- Not currently integrated with a macro system, but available for future visual polish or boss FX.

## Recommendation

Keep enabled for enhanced immersion and compatibility with animation modules or future custom effects. Can be reevaluated if performance or module conflict issues arise.
