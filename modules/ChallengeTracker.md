## Configuration Notes

## Usage Notes

- 🕓 Good fit for countdown mechanics and high-pressure narrative beats
- ⚠️ Requires manual toggle to show players — can be forgotten if not part of a prep checklist

## Maintenance & Relevance

- 📊 Simple yet flexible — fits your philosophy of minimal automation with high narrative value
