**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Used In:** Agnostic-All
**Purpose:** Enables autocompletion of user names when typing `/w` (whisper) commands in chat.

## Configuration Snapshot

## Notes

- ☐ **"Include GM Usernames List"** is **disabled** — default state.
- Autocomplete includes “GM” by default, which targets all GM-role users.
- The setting is only needed if multiple GMs are actively playing, which is not the case in current campaigns.
- Especially useful during roleplay scenes or mystery-heavy sessions where players whisper often.
