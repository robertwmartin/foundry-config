# Character Actions List dnd5e

**Version:** 7.1.1  
**Used In:** All Worlds (as long as Tidy5e doesn‚Äôt override it completely)  
**Purpose:** Adds an Actions tab to 5e character sheets that mirrors the D&D Beyond experience. Groups usable abilities by action type for fast in-combat reference.

## Configuration Snapshot

## Configuration Notes

- ‚òê **Limit Actions to Cantrips** ‚Äì disabled (include all relevant spells)
- ‚úÖ Include:
  - **Minute-long Spells**
  - **Spells with Active Effects**
  - **Consumables**
- ‚úÖ Inject Actions List for:
  - **Character Sheets**
  - **NPC Sheets**
  - **Vehicle Sheets**

This configuration ensures the Actions tab is as complete as possible for supported actors.

## Maintenance & Relevance

- ‚úÖ Maintained and compatible with Foundry V12
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Might be redundant if Tidy5e already shows a structured Actions panel
- üß≠ Still helpful for consistency and clarity, especially in player-heavy games

## Related Modules

- [[Tidy 5e Sheets]] ‚Äì may offer overlapping or alternative action UI
- [[DFreds Convenient Effects]] ‚Äì complements this by highlighting effects tied to actions
- [[Item Macro]] ‚Äì can work alongside actions for automated resolution
