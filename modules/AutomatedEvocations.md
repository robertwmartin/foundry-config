## Configuration Notes

- ⚙️ **Custom Bindings** available – not currently customized
- ✅ **Auto-Close** – closes companion window after summoning

This setup strikes a balance between automation and control, giving players a clear UI for managing their summons while ensuring performance and consistency.
