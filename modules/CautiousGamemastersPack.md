# Cautious Gamemaster's Pack

**Version:** 1.10.2  
**Used In:** All Worlds  
**Purpose:** Enhances chat and GM visibility features. You currently use this module **exclusively for the typing notification functionality**, which is not available in Foundry core.

## Configuration Snapshot

## Configuration Notes

- âœ… **Notify Typing** â€“ enabled
- âœ… **Allow players to see typing notification** â€“ enabled (players also benefit)
- âœ… **Allow players to use /desc** â€“ enabled
- July 2025 - changed settings to stop displaying scrolling healing text on NPCs to players

This minimal setup supports social communication and accessibility in games, particularly useful when players have unreliable audio/video or type long chat messages.

## Maintenance & Relevance

- âœ… Still maintained and compatible with Foundry V12
- ðŸ§  Solves a real issue not handled by core Foundry
- ðŸ’¡ Lightweight â€” fits your low-friction setup philosophy
- ðŸ§­ Should remain installed as long as you value typing visibility during roleplay or troubleshooting
