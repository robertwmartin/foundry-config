## Supported Drop Targets

This module supports the following assets for drag-and-drop onto the canvas:

- **Tokens** – instantly spawn an actor onto the scene
- **Tiles** – place decorative or functional graphics
- **Journal Entries** – drop clickable hotspots, scene lore, or GM notes
- **Audio Files** – embed environmental audio or one-shot effects
- **Lights** – add preset lighting configurations quickly
- **Measured Templates** – place spell cones, radii, etc.
- **Drawings** – drop annotated shapes or fog areas
- **Playlists/Sounds** – ambient scene control (if supported)

## Advanced Usage Ideas

- Create folders like `📁 Lighting Presets`, `📁 Summonable Creatures`, or `📁 Interactive Notes`
- Store reusable elements to quickly drop into multiple scenes
- Use dialog mode to choose layer or settings when dropping
- Combine with DFreds macro work to streamline GM scene setup

## Maintenance & Relevance

- ✅ Maintained and compatible with Foundry V12
- 🧠 Low overhead, high flexibility — worth keeping for prep use
- 🧭 Ideal for Dev World even if not needed in live play
